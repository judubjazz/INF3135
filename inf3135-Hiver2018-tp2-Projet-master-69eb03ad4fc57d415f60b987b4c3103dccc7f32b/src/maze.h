/**
 * File maze.h
 *
 * Provides a data structure for representing mazes and services for handling
 * them.
 *
 * Each maze is divided into rooms, i.e. individual unit square cells that can
 * have walls in the four basic directions (right, up, left, down). The
 * following services are available:
 *
 * - Generating a random maze with given numbers of rows and columns
 *   (`Maze_randomMaze``);
 * - Freeing a maze (``Maze_free``);
 * - Priting an ASCII representation of a maze (``Maze_print``);
 * - Checking if the rooms are consistent, i.e. for each wall between a pair of
 *   adjacent rooms, both rooms have the corresponding wall
 *   (``Maze_areRoomsConsistent``), mostly used for debugging;
 * - Computing the unique path in the maze from the room `(0,0)` to the room
 *   `(r-1,c-1)` (``Maze_path``).
